Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach
## Chapter 2
### Cleaner exercise:
To get an overview i recommend
starting in [Game.h](https://github.com/Nice2Bee/AI/blob/Chapter_2/Chapter%202/9%20Cleaner/9%20Cleaner/Game.h) read the comments, 
then go to [Area.h](https://github.com/Nice2Bee/AI/blob/Chapter_2/Chapter%202/9%20Cleaner/9%20Cleaner/Area.h) and finally to
[Agent_Vacuum_Cleaner.h](https://github.com/Nice2Bee/AI/blob/Chapter_2/Chapter%202/9%20Cleaner/9%20Cleaner/Agent_Vacuum_Cleaner.h)

Tried different kinds of cleaner agents.
Only the random agent is left.

Physics.h is not used at the moment.

To be executed the sfml .dll s must be in the same 
folder as the .exe (as you probably know), they are 
.gitignored so use this ones:
[AI/libs/SFML-2.4.2/bin/ * ](https://github.com/Nice2Bee/AI/tree/master/libs/SFML-2.4.2/bin)

license:
You can use this code for anything you want. 
The only restriction is the the sfml library
([but it's not](https://github.com/Nice2Bee/AI/blob/master/libs/SFML-2.4.2/license.txt))
