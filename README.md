Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach
## Chapter 2
### Cleaner exercise:
To get an overview i recommend
starting in [Game.h](https://github.com/Nice2Bee/AI/blob/Chapter_2/Chapter%202/9%20Cleaner/9%20Cleaner/Game.h) read the comments, 
then go to [Area.h](https://github.com/Nice2Bee/AI/blob/Chapter_2/Chapter%202/9%20Cleaner/9%20Cleaner/Area.h) and finally to
[Agent_Vacuum_Cleaner.h](https://github.com/Nice2Bee/AI/blob/Chapter_2/Chapter%202/9%20Cleaner/9%20Cleaner/Agent_Vacuum_Cleaner.h)

Tried different kinds of cleaner agents.
Only the random agent is left.

Physics.h is not used at the moment.

To be executed the sfml .dll s must be in the same 
folder as the .exe (as you probably know), they are 
gitignored so you need to use the ones from the folder:
AI/libs/SFML-2.4.2/bin/ *

license:
You can use this code for anything you want.
The only restrictions are the ones of the sfml library
(but there are none https://github.com/Nice2Bee/AI/blob/master/libs/SFML-2.4.2/license.txt)
